# Book DB

This app manages book collections. It consists of these services:

- Auth to login and signup users, giving them JWTs
- Books to manage a central repository of all books available
- Book collections to manage a user's collection of books
- Book reviews that manages how users rate and review books

## Prerequisites

- Golang v1.20+
- Docker v420+

## DB structure

TBD

## Tech stack

This is to gain more practice with gin, as opposed to net/http + gorilla/mux which has been my goto. We'll use GORM for DB interactions

## Usage

TBD
